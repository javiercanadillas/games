- Always use components from DaisyUI
- Use CDN instead of installing DaisyUI
- CDN details:

You don't need to install anything. Just add one of these to the head tag of your HTML:

<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>

Adding all themes
daisyui.css includes light and dark themes. For other themes, add themes.css file as well:

<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5/themes.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
