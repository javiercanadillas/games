# Games Showcase

This repository is a collection of simple web-based games created to showcase the power and efficiency of the Gemini CLI. The primary goal is to demonstrate how quickly one can go from an idea to a functional prototype in just a matter of minutes using Gemini.

Each game is self-contained within its own folder, making it easy to navigate and explore the code for each individual project.
